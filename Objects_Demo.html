// Everything in Javascript in an object. There are a couple
// of ways of declaring them. Here I demonstrate two ways.
// This way uses the keyword new, which is classic in PHP, C++, and other classical
// inheritance languages. However, there are some differences in they way JS uses
// Prototypal inheritance

// Object #1 
var person = new Object();
person.firstName = "Brad";
person.lastName = "Beiermann";
person.age = 22;
person.eyeColor = "blue";

// Object #2
var person2 = {
firstName: "John",
lastName: "Doe",
age: 25,
eyeColor: "brown" 
}; 

// Object #3
// Sometimes we like to have an "object type" that can be used to create many objects of one 
// type. The standard way to create an "object type" is to use an object constructor 
// function like this:
function person3(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}
var myFather = new person3("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
var myMother = new person3("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Objects 1 and 2 say " + person.firstName + " has " + person.eyeColor + " eyes and is " + person.age + " years old. Also, " + person2.firstName + " from Object 2 has " + person2.eyeColor + " eyes. " +  "Object3 says my father " + myFather.firstName + " is " + myFather.age + " years old and my mother is " + myMother.firstName + " is " + myMother.age + " years old.";
